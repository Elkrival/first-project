Space Team BlackJack

AI dealer is an alien overlord, you and your partner must make choices accordingly based on who wins the blackjack turn. If AI 
has blackjack, or a value larger than both players, the AI alien overlord will perform an attack on the spaceteam ship. If the
spaceteam players have a value higher than the alien overlord, the spaceteam will perform an attack on AI.

The workings of this code is not fully complete, however, got a working blackjack game for two players with DOM manipulation for player names
and for who wins.

The 52 cards are set in an Array, and they are defined by the images of the cards. We use a random function called dealer to loop the length of the array, and choose a random card, 
then we use the .splice function to remove 1 card from the array, and then the card is pushed to a player.
Card 1 and Card2 are the hands for player1 and Card3 and Card4 make up the hand for player2, to set the value of the cards.

I set up a function called pointSystem, that requires the card parameter. This function contains if and else statements that denominate the value of the cards, 
as of right now the ACE is only worth 1 point, Kings, Jacks and Queens are valued at 10 points.

Once we parse the value of the cards we add them for each player to get their total value, and then the winning function takes those values and compares them, 
whoever has the highest value wins or if the value is the same the players are tied.

Things to still complete. A function for Hit, this will give the player an additional card, if they are above 21 they lose, but if the value
of their hand is closer to 21 and greater than the other players then that will create a winning message, need to complete AI for 
dealer AKA alien overlord, and finish CSS styling.
